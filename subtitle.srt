00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,660
A long time ago, in an era where 
there was no concept of 'shinobi',

2
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,660
in an attempt to end an era of violence,

3
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,660
a certain someone ate a forbidden fruit

4
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,660
and gained the power of chakra.

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,660
However, as time passed, they 
became obsessed with that power.

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,100
To bring justice to the world, 
what is it that we need?

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,660
Power or love?

8
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,160
This question would start an arduous war...

9
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,660
which has continued throughout the generations.

10
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,660
Hey, if you're a Hyuga show us your Byakugan!

11
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,500
If you can't don't show your face around here!

12
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,760
Your eyes are really creepy.

13
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,460
I bet you're actually a monster, right?

14
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,300
You Byakugan monster!

15
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,170
What's your problem?

16
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,420
The 'future hokage'?

17
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
Are you some kind of moron?

18
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,660
Take that!

19
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,660
We really taught this guy a lesson!

20
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,510
What's up with this "future hokage"?

21
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,660
For being so cocky, let's take care of his red scarf!

22
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,840
If it's the end of the world,

23
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,660
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

24
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,710
This is the Hyuga's...

25
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,750
...reply!

26
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,250
Naruto-senpai!

27
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,840
You say 'steak'?

28
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,810
Thank you very much.

29
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,420
Thanks for the food!

30
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:54,130
{\an8}RINNE FESTIVAL

31
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,280
Naruto-senpai!

32
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,280
Please accept my Rinne Festival present.

33
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,550
I'm always cheering for you!

34
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,080
I made it myself!

35
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,260
Please accept it!

36
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,010
Thank you very much.

37
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,950
Coming up!

38
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,030
Five orders?!

39
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,660
I can't eat five more orders.

40
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,610
Naruto-senpai!

41
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,330
Thank you so much!

42
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,930
Over here, Senpai!

43
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,750
Let's eat together!

44
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,500
Order ready!

45
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,530
Coming!

46
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,220
Senpai, the gyoza are ready.

47
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,360
Let's eat!

48
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,880
If it's the end of the world,

49
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,720
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

50
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,000
Look, the moon.

51
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,970
The match up for the round seven...

52
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,690
Uzumaki Naruto vs.

53
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
Inuzuka Kiba.

54
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,200
Ninja Art Beast Mimicry: All-Fours jutsu.

55
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,060
Here I come.

56
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,180
Naruto-kun is fighting Pain right now.

57
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,810
Banshō Ten'in.

58
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Banshō Ten'in.

59
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,460
Soon I will take you with me.

60
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,000
If it's the end of the world,

61
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,640
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

62
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,230
{\an8}Uzumaki Naruto.

63
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,680
Senpai, the gyoza are ready.

64
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,660
Let's eat.

65
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,160
Senpai.

66
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,100
{\an8}Uzumaki Naruto.

67
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,120
Roger.

68
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,260
Hurry up and move forward!

69
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,660
I can't go any further!

70
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,220
Hey, stay in the line!

71
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,240
Keep calm. Please keep calm.

72
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,440
Hinata-sama, welcome to the castle.

73
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,730
Welcome.

74
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,020
Hinata-sama, only those of exalted status

75
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,940
are allowed to see the real Tenseigan.

76
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:06,430
This is a temple where those 
of lower rank come to pray.

77
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,840
Raikage-sama, the Chakra Cannons are ready.

78
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:31,420
Yes sir.

79
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,860
Pulverize. Powderize!

80
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:18,890
Roger!

81
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:11,160
Roger!

82
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,750
The Sixth Gate Of Joy!

83
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,890
Damn it!

84
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,280
The meteorites are gone.

85
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,730
Hokage-sama.

86
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:07,710
Hiashi-san?

87
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:11,260
Chakra capacity at 75%

88
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,990
76, 77...

89
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:13,160
Chakra capacity at 95%

90
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:18,270
96, 97, 98, 99...

91
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:21,470
Chakra is at 100%

92
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,070
Yeah!

93
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:01,330
Chakra capacity at 90%

94
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,660
Hokage-sama!

95
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,110
Hiashi-san would like to speak with you.

96
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:11,820
Do not destroy the moon...

97
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,770
I'm certain that Hanabi and Hinata are there.

98
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:55,350
Chakra capacity at 95%

99
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:58,760
Raikage-sama, an urgent 
message from Hokage-sama.

100
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:40,970
I can't shoot at Naruto.

101
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,880
Raikage-sama, there is 
something written on the moon...

102
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:55,240
Kurama is writing something on the moon's surface.

103
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:44,910
Snowball fight?!
