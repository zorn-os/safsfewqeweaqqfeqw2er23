1
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,760
Long ago, back when the concept of shinobi did not exist.

2
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,470
A certain person bit into the forbidden fruit,
and obtained the power of chakra...

3
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,100
...and tried to end the age of violence.

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,140
However, in time, They become obsessed with power.

5
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,620
To maintain order in this world,
does one need power or love?

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,820
This conflict would
spark a long war,

7
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,260
that continued through into
the generations that followed.

8
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,200
If you are Hyuuga's daughter, just show me your Byakugan.

9
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,750
If you don't want, don't look us here.

10
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,160
Your eyes are creepy.

11
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,280
I'll bet your actually a monster, right?

12
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,780
Yeah, you Byakugan monster.

13
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,720
Hey, stop!

14
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,160
Huh, who are you?

15
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,850
I'm Uzumaki Naruto,

16
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,130
the future Hokage.

17
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,050
Future Hokage?

18
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,680
Don't be stupid.

19
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,970
Be prepared.

20
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
影分身の術

22
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
(Kage Bunshin no Jutsu: "Shadow Clone Technique")

23
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,060
Huh?

24
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,360
I'll beat you.

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,220
So will I.

26
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,930
Take this!

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,200
He's weak.

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,250
The future Hokage bullshit!

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,150
Don't act so cool.

30
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm not done yet!

31
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,370
This time, I'm gonna show you an awesome technique.

32
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,480
Are you okay?

33
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,350
Yeah, I'm okay.

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
They've runied your scarf.

35
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,860
Never mind.

37
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,240
W-wait!

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,230
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
See ya.

40
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,400
If the world were to end tomorrow.

41
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,600
Who would you like to spend your last day with?

42
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,650
Like that would happen.

43
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,030
Just suppose,

44
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,570
the moon began to fall.

45
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,360
If it's the end of the world,

46
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,300
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,160
If the moon began to fall, I will protect you.

48
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,180
No, thanks. I don't need to be protected by you.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,810
Write down who you'd want to
spend your last day on Earth with.

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,590
Ah, It's impossible.

51
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,320
I don't know what my father's name,

52
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,060
my mother's name,

53
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,460
and I don't have any friends.

54
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,660
Hey, Naruto.

55
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,490
Don't throw out your paper.

56
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,470
But, it is unlikely the world will end,

57
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,620
I'm just saying "if" it does.

58
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,830
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

59
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,290
This is a Celestial Decree.

60
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,380
A Celestial Decree upon the Hyuuga Clan.

61
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,050
I will ask you one last time.

62
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,760
Answer me, Hyuuga Hiashi.

63
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,520
The answer, which will decide the future of your clan.

64
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,810
This is the Hyuuga's..

65
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,310
..reply!

66
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,230
You fool.

67
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,330
I'm gonna demonstrate some moves today.

68
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,500
Naruto-senpai!
Naruto-senpai!

69
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,550
I never expected him to become such high stakes material.

70
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,850
-Did you just say steak?
-High Stakes Popular with Girls.

71
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,180
His efforts in war two years ago.

72
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,440
Turned him into the village hero.

73
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,400
Yeah.

74
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,690
Thank you very much.

75
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,240
All right, Eat up.

76
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,950
-Thank you
-Thank you

77
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,560
Naruto-niichan.

78
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,100
Hey, Konohamaru.

79
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,660
I have something to show you.

80
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,000
-What is it?
-It's Granpa Hiruzen stuff.

81
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,090
I found it during spring cleaning.

82
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,550
Hey, Is this?

83
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,460
Don't you dare call them junk.

84
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,700
They're really precious.

85
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,700
-These are.
-They're, not junk.

86
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,660
I'm Uzumaki Naruto.

87
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,250
Time sure flies.

88
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,460
Sale's for the Rinne Festival has already started.

89
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,920
Naruto-senpai.

90
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,830
Huh?

91
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,700
Please accept my Rinne Festival present.

92
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,430
Huh?
For me?

93
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,430
I'm always cheering for you.

94
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,720
I made it myself.

95
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,930
-Please accept it.
-Please accept it.

96
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,730
H-Hey, Thanks.

97
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,600
Thank you very much.

98
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,610
Hinata.

99
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,300
Oh, Sakura-san.

100
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,280
Hmm?
Knitting something?

101
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,610
That's a surprise.

102
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,620
I'm making a scarf.

103
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Hmm...

104
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,240
W-What is it?

105
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,000
Give it your all, okay?

106
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,120
Huh?

107
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,630
It's a present for him, right?

108
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,600
He's been really popular, lately.

109
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,510
Oh, really?

110
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,400
They even come all the way from other villages.
Just to take pictures of him.

111
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,810
Oh.

112
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,980
Don't say "oh"

113
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
Hurry up and finish that scarf.

114
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,990
Okay.

115
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,950
Come on, have more confidence.

116
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,620
Be bold.

117
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,700
O-Okay.

118
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,150
It looks a little big.

119
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,850
All done.

120
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,570
I put my heart and soul into it.

121
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,950
I'm sure my feelings will reach Naruto-kun.

122
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,580
But will they?

123
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,200
It's already late. 
Maybe tomorrow's better.

124
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,210
Nope, I'll give it to him tonight.

125
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,610
Maybe tomorrow.

126
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,690
No, Tonight.

127
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
No, Tomorrow's

128
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,550
Just hurry up and tell him how you feel.

129
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,480
Hanabi.

130
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,770
Why didn't you say you we're there.

131
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,780
Watching a girl agonize over love is fun.

132
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,530
There's no way for a child to talk.

133
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,110
I'm not a child.

134
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,000
My Byakugan's perception is as good as any grown-up.

135
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,950
Anyway, look.

136
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,700
Isn't it cute?

137
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,080
Treating your kunai like a toy again.

138
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,930
He'll burst out laughing if your tummy growls while confessing your love.

139
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,550
I'm not going to confess anything.

140
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,390
Rather that giving him a scarf,

141
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,350
maybe you should make yourself look more fashionable.

142
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,020
The moon is falling.

143
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,140
The moon is clearly getting closer to earth.

144
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,290
Is that why there have been more meteorites lately?

145
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,190
I'll explain.

146
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,080
As two celestial bodies get closer to each other,

147
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,780
their gravity will began to pull.

148
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,700
Once a certain distance is reached.

149
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,780
The moon surface will begin to break apart.

150
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,750
I believe a part of the surface has begun to fall to earth.

151
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,660
And what will happen?

152
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,660
The moon will completely disintegrate.

153
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,410
And it's fragments will rain over the Earth's surface.

154
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,210
If nothing is done, mankind will...

155
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,010
Perish.

156
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,010
Is this a natural phenomenon?

157
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,260
Or is this a Man-made assault.

158
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,520
That's a good question.

159
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,610
It's getting to be the season when ramen really hits the spot.

160
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,030
You only eat ramen all year long.

161
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,030
You really like ramen, don't you?

162
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,200
Yup, I love it.

163
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,660
Five more orders of gyoza.

164
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,330
-Coming right up.
-Five more orders?

165
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,950
I can't eat that much.

166
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,540
Then don't have any.

167
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,540
Time to dig in-

168
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,630
Can't get this dirty.

169
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,300
Hey, That scarf.

170
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,300
Oh, Hinata.

171
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,800
Join us, If you haven't eaten.

172
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,380
It's on me tonight.

173
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,730
He said something made him happy and he wants to celebrate.

174
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,090
B-But...

175
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,900
Don't be shy, come and sit here.

176
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,980
Join us, Hinata.

177
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
O-Okay.

178
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,150
Naruto-senpai!

179
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,160
Hey, It's you guys.

180
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
Thanks for the presents the other day.

181
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,400
Order whatever you want.

182
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,000
It's my treat.
My thanks for the presents.

183
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,920
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

184
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,430
Hinata, order what you want too.

185
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,340
-Over here, Senpai.
-Huh?

186
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,340
Let's eat together.

187
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,340
Hinata.

188
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,010
What's wrong?

189
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,640
I'm sorry
Actually, I'm quite full.

190
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,760
-Huh?
-Hinata.

191
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,140
Why don't you walk her home.

192
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,230
Walk Hinata home.

193
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Why?

194
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,440
Well.

195
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,070
-You can't let a young girl
-Order up. Gyoza.

196
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,030
-Walk home alone at night.
-Thank you.

197
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,030
Huh. Hinata's really strong.

198
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,280
No one in the village would dare mess with her.

199
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,240
Hey.

200
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,450
Hinata.

201
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,450
Oh, you're such an idiot.

202
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,950
Why'd you call me an idiot?

203
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,040
Senpai, the gyoza is ready.

204
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Let's eat.

205
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,840
He can be so dense.

206
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,590
You we're going to give him the scarf, right?

207
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,590
Uh-huh.

208
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,180
You can do it. Hinata.
Be confident.

209
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,060
Thanks.

210
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,810
But how come you're encouraging me so much.

211
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,810
Huh? Well...

212
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,610
We need to support each other.

213
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,130
Support each other?

214
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,120
Who's there?

215
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,250
That's Hanabi.

216
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,040
Chōjū Giga!

217
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,040

(Chōjū Giga: "Super Beast Imitating Drawing ")

219
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,020
Naruto-kun.

220
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:11,110
I've always gazed at your back.

221
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,450
But from now on, I want to always.

222
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,290
Always stand by your side.

223
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,250
So, I knitted this with all my heart.

224
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,300
Please accept my feelings.

225
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,220
All right, one more time.

226
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,390
Naruto-kun.

227
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,390
Hinata.

228
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,520
Good evening.

229
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,020
We saw each other earlier at Ichiraku.

230
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,520
Oh, That's right.

231
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,990
What's the matter?

232
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,740
Th-That's a nice scarf.

233
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,450
Oh, yeah.

234
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,750
Hey, sounds like you're hungry.

235
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,210
If you don't mind instant ramen, I have some in my room.

236
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,380
Good night.

237
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,670
Didn't you want to talk to me?

238
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,510
Hey, Hinata.

239
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,890
I wonder who gave it to him.

240
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,900
I'm happy for you naruto.

241
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,490
Why are you crying?

242
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,370
You're getting the scarf wet.

243
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,790
I don't need it anymore.

244
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,460
Then I'll take it.

245
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,170
Who are you?

246
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,260
I'm Toneri. 
I've come for you.

247
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,130
Come for me?

248
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,020
-Hinata!
-What, let me go.

249
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,020
Bastard, what are you doing to Hinata?

250
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,710
Tajū Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!

251
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,710

252
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,710
(Tajū Kage Bunshin no Jutsu: "Multiple Shadow Clone Technique ")

253
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,220
Hinata.

254
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,630
Rasenshuriken!

255
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,630
螺旋手裏剣

256
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,630
(Rasenshuriken: "Spiralling Shuriken")

257
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,050
Why you.

258
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,550
Let Hinata go.

259
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,550
Hold it!

260
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,360
Hinata, Are you okay?

261
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,410
Yeah.

262
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,840
Rasengan!

263
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,840
螺旋丸

264
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,840
(Rasengan: "Spiralling Sphere")

265
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,260
My body is going numb.

266
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,770
My strength...

267
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,150
Hinata!

268
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,500
Your scarf's ruined.

269
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:32,830
Yes.

270
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,830
Where'd those shinobi come from?

271
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,960
I don't know

272
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,300
The final day is approaching.

273
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,010
Before that...

274
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,050
You bastard!

275
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,770
Before that day, I will come for you.

276
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,640
Hinata.

277
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,500
What is that?

278
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,650
W-What's going on?

279
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,580
The Earth..

280
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,710
..will be destroyed, soon.

281
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,340
Your mission is to.

282
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,800
Rescue Hyuga Hanabi who has been kidnapped.

283
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,310
You'll be working as a 4-man team led by Shikamaru.

284
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,810
I'm also granting Hinata's wish to be included in this team.

285
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,310
Thank you very much.

286
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,310
Shikamaru, put your hand out!

287
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,730
Huh?

288
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,980
Why?

289
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,030
What's this?

290
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,740
A top secret clock that only five kage possess.

291
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,910
What kind of clock is it?

292
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,750
It's counting down the time until the Earth's destruction.

293
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,540
I don't get it.

294
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,590
Why's this necessary for Hanabi's rescue.

295
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,590
Toneri, the one who kidnapped Hanabi,

296
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,010
could be the one manipulating the moon.

297
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,300
What are you basing this on?

298
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,800
It's just a hunch.

299
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,230
It was around here..

300
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,980
..that I lost sight of Hanabi's kidnapper.

301
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,510
Let's split up and search for clues.

302
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,780
Naruto, take care of Hinata.

303
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,030
Leave it to me.

304
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,910
What is it?

305
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,710
Oh, nothing.

306
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,090
-Oh.
-What is it?

307
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,310
It's Hanabi's kunai.

308
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,690
Hmm, you brought the scarf?

309
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,520
Huh?

310
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,530
Why aren't you using it? 
Aren't you cold?

311
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,240
I-I'm fine.

312
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,990
Anyways, we'd better hurry and let Shikamaru and the others know.

313
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,660
Oh, yeah. You're right.

314
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,790
What do you see Hinata?

315
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,590
There's a spring that glowing at the bottom of the cave.

316
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,760
A spring that's glowing?

317
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,470
That shinobi letter is "A" as in Aun.

318
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,890
It could mean "This is the beginning"

319
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,930
Hinata, what can you see at the bottom of the spring?

320
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,940
My vision is distorted.

321
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,560
Your Byakugan is distorting?

322
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,440
Well, just have to go down and see.

323
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,230
Whoa, I can't get this wet.

324
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,030
You're so particular.

325
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,530
What's the big deal if your scarf got wet?

326
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,470
It's a big deal. This means a lot to me.

327
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:35,870
Huh?

328
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,540
There is nothing to worry about.

329
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,500
I touched this water and I didn't get wet.

330
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,880
If the world were to end tomorrow,

331
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,960
who would you like to spend your last day with?

332
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,950
Like that would happen?

333
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,750
Just suppose the moon began to fall.

334
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If it's the end of the world.

335
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,840
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon.

336
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,740
Look, the moon!

337
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,140
Huh?

338
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,320
The match-up for round 7.

339
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,740
Uzumaki Naruto versus..

340
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,030
..Inuzuka Kiba.

341
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,120

343
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,410

Here I come.

349
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,460
Stop it, Kiba.

350
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,800
Naruto-kun is fighting pain right now.

351
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,350

What is it?

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
It's ointment.

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,380
I'm going to save you, Naruto-kun.

370
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,380
I was always crying and giving up before even trying.

371
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,010
I made so many mistakes.

372
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,600
But, you helped me find my way and take the correct path, Naruto-kun.

373
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,140
I always chased after you.

374
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,400
I wanted to walk beside you all the time.

375
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:00,240
I want to be at your side, Always.

376
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,030
You changed me, Naruto-kun.

377
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,490
Your smile is what saved me.

378
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,710
That's why, I'm not afraid to die..

379
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,210
..if it means I can protect you.

380
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,800
Because..

381
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,050
I love you, Naruto-kun.

382
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,560
Hinata.

383
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,810
If the world were to end tomorrow,

384
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,070
who would you like to spend the last day with?

385
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,610
If it's the end of the world,

386
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,450
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon.

387
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,240
Not Iruka-sensei again.

388
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,160
Write down who'd you want to spend your last day on Earth with.

389
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,460
Hey, Naruto.

390
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,920
Don't throw out you paper.

391
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,090
But, there's no way that the world's gonna end.

392
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,260
I'm just saying "if" it does.

393
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Well it ain't gonna happen.

394
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,730
"Uzumaki Naruto"

395
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,030
Huh? Me?

396
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,990
Naruto-kun.

397
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,450
What is it?

398
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,830
It's ointment.

399
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,450
Why're you giving it to me?

400
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,830
-So dense.
-Huh?

401
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,710
He can be so dense.

402
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,670
You were going to give him that scarf, weren't you?

403
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,260
Uh-Huh.

404
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,720
You can do it, Hinata.

405
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,260
Be confident.

406
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,260
Thanks.

407
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,180
Naruto-kun, I...

408
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,180
You really like ramen, don't you?

409
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,060
Yup, I love it.

410
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,770
Naruto-kun, I...

411
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,440
You really like.

412
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,030
Yup, I love Hinata.

413
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,030
He's so dense.

414
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,740
Maybe he doesn't know what love is.

415
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,160
What do you mean?

416
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,530
Like knowing the difference between loving sweets,

417
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,950
like shiratama dumplings and fruit gelatin and love.

418
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,960
Huh, They're not the same?

419
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,500
Hinata.

420
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,380
Oh, you're such and idiot.

421
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,050
Why'd you call me an idiot?

422
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,180
Senpai, the gyoza are ready.

423
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,680
Let's eat.

424
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,810
-Hinata.
-Oh.

425
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,310
Senpai!

426
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,690
Hinata!

427
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,750
"Uzumaki Naruto"

428
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,130
Hinata.

429
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,000
That's why I'm not afraid to die..

430
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,340
..if it means I can protect you.

431
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,360
Because, Naruto-kun..

432
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,760
I love you.

433
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,730
Hinata.

434
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,980
Naruto.

435
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,020
Wake up.

436
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,650
This is a dream.

437
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,200
Oh, Sakura-chan.

438
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,570
You're finally awake.

439
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,580
Is this a trap set by the enemy?

440
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,420
Yeah, it traps intruders in a Genjutsu.

441
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,080
And shuts them away in a world of memories.

442
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,590
It's a prison of caged memories.

443
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,460
Thank goodness Sakura who's resistant to Genjutsu was with us.

444
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,760
Thanks, Sakura..

445
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,570
..for breaking a fun dream with my big brother apart.

446
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,390
That doesn't sound like gratitude.

447
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,560
Another spring?

448
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,770
Your Byakugan doesn't work here either?

449
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,770
No, my field of sight is distorted.

450
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,860
All right, be ready to fight as we proceed.

451
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,150
-Roger.
-Roger.

452
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,280
What's the matter?

453
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,790
About those Ginjutsu dreams earlier.

454
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,660
What is it?

455
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,630
No, never mind.

456
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,050
Hinata.

457
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,390
I said I'd come for you..

458
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,230
..to have you come to me.

459
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,600
Where is Hanabi?

460
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,860
Don't worry. 
She's fast asleep in my castle.

461
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,570
Return Hanabi.

462
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,450
That will all depend on your answer.

463
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,120
Byakugan Princess.

464
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,370
Byakugan Princess?

465
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,460
Hinata, let's get married. 

466
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,830
Huh? marry?

467
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,450
It's like a bubble factory.

468
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,190
I get it.

469
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,810
Huh?

470
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,730
This is were the gatekeeper who made the bubbles lives.

471
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,570
Gatekeeper?

472
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,690
Naruto and Hinata are late.

473
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,700
Should we go back to check?

474
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,540
A-A crab?

475
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,910
That's the gatekeeper.

476
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,710
Hinata.

477
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,710
Naruto-kun.

478
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,340
Don't get near Hinata.

479
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,260
You again. You're in the way. Move!

480
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,970
Where is Hanabi?

481
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,140
Don't destroy the bubbles.

482
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,520
Or we'll get caught by the Genjutsu again.

483
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,030
Chōjū Giga!

484
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,030
超獣偽画

485
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,030
(Chōjū Giga: "Super Beast Imitating Drawing")

486
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,370
Fujin. Raijin.

487
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,020
Damn it.

488
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,730
Kage Nui!

489
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,730
影縫い

490
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,730
(Kage Nui: "Shadow Sewing")

491
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,650
Sakura.

492
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,580
Shannaro!

493
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,580
(Shannaro: "A word that always shouts out by Sakura when she's pissed or extremely excited, could be used as "Alright, damnit!" or "F*ck yeah!")

494
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,250
Damn it.

495
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,730
You're a puppet?

496
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,780
This is not my body.

497
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,370
Hinata.

498
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,830
Next time, the real me will come for you.

499
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,750
Give me an answer then.

500
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,300
Shut up!

501
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:05,050
Your fist will never reach me, never.

502
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,650
Did your punch do this, Sakura-chan?

503
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,650
Oh, Yeah.

504
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,940
Naruto, if you leave Hinata behind and expose her to danger again,

505
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,660
you'll get a taste of my fists too.

506
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,990
I know.

507
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,120
Hinata, I'll never let you..

508
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,080
I'll never let you out of my sight again.

509
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,330
What?

510
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,080
You're already looking away.

511
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,210
Huh, I'm not looking away.

512
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,850
What is this place?

513
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,490
Is that island floating?

514
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,070
No.

515
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,370
The surface of the ocean is warped.

516
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,290
There's sunlight underground too.

517
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,120
Isn't that a fake?

518
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,660
An artificial sun?

519
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,370
Yeah.

520
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,260
Hinata, any sign of the enemy?

521
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,130
No, we're good.

522
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,640
The enemy is aware of us.

523
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,640
Why aren't they attacking?

524
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,270
Yeah, that bothers me.

525
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,100
It's too quiet.

526
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,360
Leave them.

527
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,900
Don't do anything until I go to get her.

528
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,450
Oh..

529
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,620
the eyes are twitching again.

530
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,870
Amazing, this Byakugan is very pure.

531
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,460
Hinata?

532
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,360
That scarf, seriously is it for me?

533
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,350
I see a town about 20 kilos ahead.

534
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,680
All right, let's go.

535
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,830
There's no one here.

536
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,090
This town was built a few centuries ago.

537
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,180
Let's split up and search.

538
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,890
So, it's a shinobi village.

539
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,180
A fire?

540
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,060
What is this?

541
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,780
Was there a war long ago?

542
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,280
What's wrong? Hinata?

543
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,280
It's a spider web.

544
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,080
You can see far with your Byakugan,

545
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,910
but you walk straight to the spider web.

546
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,250
You're so silly.

547
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Naruto-kun.

548
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,670
What is it?

549
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,870
What happened to your scarf?

550
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,490
Oh.

551
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,140
It's warm underground, So I took it off.

552
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,730
I-I see.

553
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,110
I feel a bit cold.

554
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,400
I'll bet you are, dressed like that.

555
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,110
It's just that, this is my mission gear.

556
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,990
If you can take it,

557
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,910
I can handle a little cold like this.

558
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,200
Are you okay?

559
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,420
I'm totally fine.

560
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,210
What?

561
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,000
It's nothing.

562
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,210
What is it?

563
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,130
I said, it's nothing.

564
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,430
Tell me.

565
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,640
That was so good.

566
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,360
Are you going somewhere?

567
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,690
I'm gonna take a leak.

568
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,740
Naruto-kun.

569
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,290
A spider web.

570
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,000
Are you okay?

571
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,410
Yeah.

572
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,290
Ow.

573
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,620
What's wrong?

574
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,590
I think I hurt my back.

575
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,830
Here you go.

576
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,210
Thanks.

577
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,220
Oh yeah,

578
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,010
you gave me some ointment back during chuunin exams.

579
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,640
You remembered all this time.

580
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,770
Actually, I just remembered.

581
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,210
Thanks.

582
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,930
We have to hurry and rescue Hanabi.

583
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,560
Naruto-kun, I'd like to talk to you about something.

584
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,600
What is it?

585
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,400
About what you said when that puppet Toneri appeared.

586
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,610
Toneri?

587
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,610
Here they are.

588
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,450
Hinata, we need you to check something.

589
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,490
What's it say?

590
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,590
It's some ancient writing.

591
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,000
Ancient oath.

592
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,000
Crossing the path of humanity.

593
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,720
Like all else.

594
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,330
The fist of the Tensei eye the reborn moon,

595
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,540
will destroy man.

596
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,130
What does that mean?

597
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Maybe the "Tensei Eye" is making the moon move.

598
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,430
So, Kakashi-sensei was right?

599
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,600
Hanabi's abduction and the moon are somehow connected.

600
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,770
Well, his hunches are always on target unfortunately.

601
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,350
Byakugan Princess.

602
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,230
What's that?

603
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,930
Is this a burial site?

604
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,340
What's this?

605
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,230
Someone's here.

606
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:01,260
The Byakugan. I sense the Byakugan.

607
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,140
Oh, I'm certain of it.

608
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,940
Oh, Byakugan Princess.

609
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,850
Stay away from Hinata.

610
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,460
Hinata.

611
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,180
What did you do to Hinata?

612
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,980
The Tenseigan has revived.

613
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,060
It must be stopped.

614
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,270
Otsutsuki.

615
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,660
Hinata, are you all right?

616
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,360
Uh-huh.

617
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,240
That man said something like Otsutsuki.

618
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,870
That's the original surname of the Sage of Six Paths.

619
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,400
That was the name of the Sage of Six Paths, before he entered the priesthood.

620
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,080
And he called Hinata the Byakugan Princess.

621
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,540
Otsutsuki Hagoromo.

622
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,840
Seems Toneri's abduction of Hanabi is connected.

623
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,180
Knitting.

624
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,890
Is she going to keep knitting forever?

625
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,440
I guess it takes a lot of time.

626
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,890
Hinata, what was it that you wanted to talk about earlier?

627
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,160
You mentioned something about what Toneri's puppet said?

628
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,580
Oh, that. 
It was nothing.

629
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,210
Huh? What did you mean nothing?

630
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,500
I'm sorry, I want to be alone.

631
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,050
I see.

632
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,160
Let's check out that village.

633
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,370
Seems like Hanabi's not here anymore.

634
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,790
We should head back and rejoin the others.

635
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,060
Uh-huh.

636
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,750
Hinata.

637
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,920
My younger sister is in so much danger,

638
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,630
and here I'm knitting.

639
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,430
I'm a terrible big sister, aren't I?

640
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,060
That's not true.

641
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:18,060
You've come all this way just to save your sister.

642
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,150
I'm sure if I stayed at home then Hanabi will be safe.

643
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:25,400
Don't worry, I swear I will rescue Hanabi.

644
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,940
Thank you.

645
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,320
You're so kind, Naruto-kun.

646
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,960
Hey, I'm not just being kind because I love you or anything.

647
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,830
I'm just worried about Hanabi.

648
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,380
-What did you just say?
-Huh?

649
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,840
Did you say something?

650
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,510
I'm worried about Hanabi.

651
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,390
Before that...

652
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,490
Before that is..

653
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:01,650
Hinata..

654
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,740
I... love you.

655
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,290
Hinata.

656
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,650
Toneri, are you another puppet?

657
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,650
Where is Hanabi?

658
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:50,780
Silence!

659
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,450
I came to hear Hinata's answer.

660
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:57,330
Answer? Hinata has nothing to say to you!

661
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,740
So, Where's Hanabi?

662
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,000
Hinata.

663
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:06,380
Hey.

664
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,550
Hinata, what's going on?

665
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,100
Good-bye, Naruto-kun.

666
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:21,390
Huh?

667
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,460
Hinata.

668
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,940
Give Hinata back.

669
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,400
Give her back?

670
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,530
Hinata came to me willingly.

671
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,490
This has been destined. 
Since ancient times.

672
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,660
Hinata and I shall be married.

673
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,990
M-Marry?

674
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,000
Hinata.

675
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,210
That's a lie, right?

676
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,190
My chakra is...

677
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,550
What are you doing?

678
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,550
I don't want to get into a petty fight.

679
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,550
And risk getting you hurt.

680
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,840
Hinata.

681
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,230
Hurry up and go.

682
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,480
I can't go any further.

683
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,030
Hey, stay in line.

684
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,490
Don't panic.

685
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,240
The air raid shelter was constructed..

686
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,660
..to accommodate every citizen in the Land of Fire.

687
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,250
Keep calm.
Please keep calm.

688
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,130
Suiton: Suiryūdan!

689
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,130
水遁:水龍弾

690
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,130
(Suiton: Suiryūdan: "Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet")

691
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,130
Yōton: Yōkai no Jutsu!

692
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,130
溶遁:溶怪の術

693
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,130
(Yōton: Yōkai no Jutsu: "Lava Release: Melting Apparition Technique")

694
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,140
Jinton: Genkai Hakuri no Jutsu!

695
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,140
塵遁:原界剥離の術

696
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,140
(Jinton: Genkai Hakuri no Jutsu: "Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique")

697
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,640
Damn it, my back.

698
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,280
So, this was the moon?

699
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,390
Yeah.

700
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,450
The space where we found the crab's bubbles..

701
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,780
..is probably the passage way that connects the earth to the moon.

702
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,170
How is Naruto doing?

703
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,330
Terrible.

704
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,540
Most of his chakra has been sucked out.

705
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,010
Hinata.

706
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,560
So you finally get it.
You blockhead.

707
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,230
So beautiful.

708
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,980
Hinata, I want to know more about you.

709
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,410
Why him?

710
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,250
Where am I?

711
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,470
This is, Toneri's castle.

712
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:26,110
Hanabi.

713
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,400
Hanabi's eyes have been taken.

714
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,580
Hinata.

715
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,460
Let's get married.

716
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,710
Huh? Married?

717
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,300
What are you saying?
Let Hanabi.

718
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:51,050
Your sister is in my castle.

719
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:52,100
Hanabi.

720
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:57,980
I've taken her Byakugan.

721
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,440
You're terrible.

722
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:02,440
I'm sorry.

723
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,650
It's due to Hamura's Celestial Decree.

724
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,650
Hamura?

725
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,740
Otsutsuki Hamura,
The founder of the Shinobi of the Moon.

726
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,660
Perhaps, It's easier to understand if i say he's the younger brother

727
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,740
of the Sage of Six Paths, founder of the Shinobi of Earth.

728
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:19,250
Your Hyuuga Clan inherited Hamura's blood.

729
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,130
The story goes back many eons.
Several millenia, in fact.

730
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,880
The Sage of Six Paths, the elder one, had misgivings.

731
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,790
He feared that the Ten Tails..

732
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,640
..with it's massive chakra and immeasurable power..

733
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,780
..would bring calamity to the world.

734
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,740
So, The Sage of Six Paths extracted the Ten Tails Chakra..

735
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,230
..and divided it among nine Tailed Beasts in order to weaken it's power.

736
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,090
The Husk of the Ten Tails whose chakra was extracted..

737
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,200
..namely the Gedo Statue, was hidden away and sealed on the moon.

738
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,750
So that the Ten Tails would never be revived.

739
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,000
Hamura decided to live on the moon..

740
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,040
..in order to guard the Gedo statue.

741
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:07,010
The Sage of Six Paths became the founder of the Shinobi of Earth.

742
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,260
But, Hamura was skeptical of the world..

743
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,260
..his elder brother was creating.

744
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,540
So, If the world created by his brother went astray from the Shinobi way..

745
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,730
He entrusted his descendants with its destruction..

746
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,330
..through the millenia that has passed.

747
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,240
Fighting between Shinobi has not ceased,

748
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,660
they continue to use chakra as a weapon.

749
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,030
Ultimately, The Gedo Statue was stolen,

750
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,040
and even the Ten Tails was revived.

751
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,660
Our Clan has reached the conclusion..

752
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,440
..that the Shinobi of Earth will destroy the world's peace and order.

753
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:50,340
The world that the Sage of Six Paths created is a failure.

754
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,260
So, in accordance with the Celestial Decree of Hamura

755
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,850
I will destroy the world of the Sage of Six Paths.

756
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:02,760
When this pure Byakugan synergizes with my chakra,

757
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,160
it will transform into Tenseigan.

758
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,120
With it's visual prowess, I will pick up the ashes of Earth..

759
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,900
..and create a new world.

760
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,530
I don't believe your story.

761
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,530
And I'm going to rescue Hanabi.

762
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,240
Even when you don't know where the castle is located?

763
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,080
I'll return for you answer.

764
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,090
Hinata.

765
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,430
Good morning.

766
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:42,640
I'm happy that you understand how I feel, Hinata.

767
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,140
Hinata-sama, welcome to the castle.

768
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,360
-Welcome
-Welcome.

769
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,940
There are only puppets in this castle.

770
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,570
They're marionettes left here by our ancestors.

771
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,080
Since my father died when I was young,

772
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,330
I've lived in the castle all by myself.

773
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,940
We will hold the marriage ceremony here.

774
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,050
Then we will enter the Room of Rebirth..

775
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,900
..and fall into a deep slumber..

776
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,800
..until the Earth's environment stabilizes after its destruction,

777
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,280
That's impossible.

778
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,350
The moon will also be destroyed.

779
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,640
Don't worry, this castle is protected by a strong chakra.

780
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,230
Is that chakra really that strong?

781
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,730
Yes, strong enough to move the moon.

782
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,820
What do you mean?

783
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,010
It's the power of Otsutsuki's treasure..

784
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,360
..honed from the sufferings of my clan.

785
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,480
Where would such a thing be?

786
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:43,650
That is something..

787
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:48,750
..I cannot tell you.

788
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,290
May I return to my room? 
It's cold outside.

789
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,390
That's because It's dusk here all year.

790
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:02,880
Oh, That's right.

791
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,840
Will you knit me a scarf?

792
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,440
Huh?

793
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,350
A scarf just for me.

794
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:14,940
Do you refuse?

795
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,030
I understand.

796
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,530
Really? Thank you.

797
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,530
You've made me happy, Hinata.

798
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:29,870
What's wrong?

799
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:31,880
Don't worry.

800
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,670
It's proof that the Byakugan is maturing into the Tenseigan.

801
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,050
It will subside with a little rest.

802
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,390
It doesn't seem to be here.

803
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,150
Byakugan Princess.

804
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,590
Tenseigan, activate.

805
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,130
We are descendants of Hamura.

806
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:06,640
We belong to the main family of the Otsutsuki Clan.

807
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,680
We were annihilated by the branch family..

808
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,980
..who was twisted the interception of Hamura's Celestial Decree.

809
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:18,730
Toneri, a descendant of the branch family is attempting to make the moon..

810
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,640
..fall into the earth using the power of the Tenseigan.

811
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:31,040
Only you can destroy the Tenseigan, Byakugan Princess.

812
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,350
You are Otsutsuki Hamura.

813
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,350
Byakugan Princess.

814
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,820
Do not let the world my elder brother created come to an end.

815
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:11,790
Hanabi, You poor thing.

816
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:18,330
I'll definitely find and destroy.. 
The Tenseigan.

817
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,550
Imagine that..

818
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,290
Toneri has been hiding in the artificial sun.

819
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,730
Why hasn't Hinata's Byakugan able to discover it?

820
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:32,130
Maybe, he has a jutsu on the artificial sun that deflects the Byakugan too?

821
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,270
Where's the entrance?

822
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:36,810
Why don't we ask them?

823
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:43,230
What are you doing?

824
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,690
You've alerted the enemy.

825
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,360
Follow me.

826
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,950
What are you doing?

827
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:49,450
I'll explain later.

828
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,880
So, is that how it is.

829
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,510
Sai, Retreat.

830
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,690
Chōjū Giga!

831
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,690
超獣偽画

832
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,690
(Chōjū Giga: "Super Beast Imitating Drawing")

833
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,280
I never imagined that his turn to appear would come after the war,

834
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,700
when the world was peaceful.

835
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:38,160
Beneath is the chakra Diffusion Cannon.

836
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:42,250
We'll blast all the meteorites above the equator.

837
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:45,130
On top is the chakra Transportation Cannon..

838
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:48,630
..it can transport any target into another dimension.

839
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:50,630
With these we'll destroy the moon.

840
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,560
Everyone, get the cannons ready immediately.

841
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,360
Meals are nice when you have someone to talk to.

842
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:08,610
Now, tell me all about yourself.

843
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:14,450
It's not too late to negotiate with the shinobi of Earth.

844
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,280
What?

845
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:16,540
You're right.

846
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,950
The Shinobi of Earth have used chakra..

847
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:20,350
..and continued fighting.

848
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,960
But, it's different now.

849
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:25,270
In order to protect this hard-fought peace,

850
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,740
shinobi have joined together.

851
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:27,960
So...

852
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,720
They will start another war.

853
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,550
The Sage of Six Paths' world must be destroyed.

854
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,140
But...

855
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,600
Never bring up that subject again.

856
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,810
Now be quiet and eat.

857
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:51,700
That island.

858
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:53,660
So, it's appeared already.

859
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,120
This is the Temple of the Hamura.

860
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,660
Once a year, during the Rebirth Festival it comes near the castle.

861
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:08,420
I'm sure of it.

862
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:13,090
The Tenseigan is hidden on that island.

863
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:21,310
Good-bye, Naruto-kun.

864
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:23,850
Hinata.

865
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:26,860
Hinata.

866
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,960
You're finally awake.

867
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:30,440
Finally?

868
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,280
It's been three days.

869
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:33,900
Huh?

870
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:37,300
Did something happen between you and Hinata?

871
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,790
No, not really.

872
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,210
You kept groaning her name.
Hinata, Hinata.

873
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,330
As well as some other embarassing things.

874
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:49,840
But, I got to listen in on your mushy side.

875
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,090
It was such great research material for me.

876
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:52,760
Come on.

877
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:57,260
Naruto.

878
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,680
Let's go rescue Hinata and Hanabi.

879
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,980
Is it hard to see the woman who dumped you?

880
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:09,650
So, Naruto's strong as a Shinobi but he can't handle a broken heart.

881
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,040
Now, I know your weakness.

882
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,440
Hey.

883
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:21,440
Hamura must be happy that you personally want to play homage.

884
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,090
The Tenseigan is inside here.

885
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,100
This is...

886
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,270
The Tenseigan.

887
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:53,190
Then this is Otsutsuki's treasure that is moving the moon?

888
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:58,000
Hinata-sama, only those in exalted positions..

889
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,850
..are allowed to see the real Tenseigan.

890
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,400
This is a temple where others of lower rank come to pray.

891
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,040
I see.

892
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,970
I shall show you the real Tenseigan after we are married.

893
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,480
My field of vision is distorted only at that spot.

894
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,330
I see, I get it.

895
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,200
How long are you going to be like that?

896
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,790
You gave up on a woman..

897
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,540
So, why not giving up on becoming a Hokage too? 

898
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,050
Yeah, give it up.

899
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:57,260
Give up on the woman as well as becoming Hokage.

900
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,470
What? Shikamaru?

901
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:00,870
Are you picking a fight?

902
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:03,640
I don't care what happens between you and Hinata.

903
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,060
But you're a Shinobi.

904
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:05,510
Huh?

905
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,430
Come with me.

906
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,160
I'm going to my room to rest.

907
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm looking forward to the finished scarf.

908
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:46,680
I feel it, I can feel it.

909
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,390
The beating in my eyes.

910
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,980
It will be born very soon.

911
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:56,020
The complete Tenseigan.

912
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:05,630
Sakura-chan.

913
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,450
It's the result of infusing nearly every ounce of her chakra into you..

914
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,580
..so that she could prevent you from dying.

915
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,560
Sakura-chan.

916
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:17,860
Naruto.

917
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,530
Sakura-chan, I'm so sorry.

918
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:22,550
Are you going to depend on Sakura to heal not only his body..

919
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,840
..but his heart as well?

920
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,940
Can you do it? 

921
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,270
You have a point.

922
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,600
I see.

923
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:39,940
I never thought you'd confess your love first.

924
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,910
Remember long ago, when you said you love me?

925
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:51,830
But, wasn't that because I love Sasuke-kun?

926
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:54,830
You didn't want to lose to him.

927
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:00,050
It's real this time, Isn't it?

928
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,330
Hinata, is a great person.

929
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,630
She's almost too good for you. 

930
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,050
But, it's over.

931
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,560
Hinata, went to Toneri.

932
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,180
You are so stupid.

933
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,230
It's obvious that she had a reason that she couldn't reveal.

934
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,610
When a girl truly falls in love,

935
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,900
her feelings don't change so easily.

936
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:25,530
They can't change.

937
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,030
I understand how she feels very well.

938
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:02,820
This is..

939
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,290
The Tenseigan.

940
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,540
I'll stop the moon.

941
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,730
What's going on?

942
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,940
You're wrong.

943
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,450
What?

944
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:52,410
Hamura's soul entrusted me with the Celestial Decree.

945
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:56,250
You have distorted Hamura's teachings.

946
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:00,500
Hamura never wished for the destruction of Earth..

947
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,630
..The Sage of Six Path's world.

948
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,800
You've betrayed me.

949
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,390
Please hear me out. Hamura is...

950
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,680
Silence! 
They're lies.

951
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,300
I don't believe it.

952
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:16,640
There is only one Celestial Decree that Hamura made.

953
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,230
That is to end the world of the Sage of Six Paths.

954
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:20,640
Damn it.

955
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,650
So, you were knitting this..

956
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:23,940
..for him and not me?

957
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:38,250
I'm going to make it so.

958
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,120
You'll never betray me again.

959
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,000
Hinata.

960
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,760
This big idiot finally understands.

961
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:55,360
The meaning of the scarf you gave me when you went to Toneri.

962
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,850
I know now, from the scarf you painstakingly knitted..

963
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,290
..and took so long to finish.

964
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,360
That your love can't be unraveled so easily.

965
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:16,190
Naruto-kun.

966
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:20,080
Wait for me.

967
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,880
You've love someone like me forever and ever.

968
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,200
Now, as a man, there's something I've got to say to you.

969
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:39,640
Hinata, I swear I'm gonna save you.

970
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,640
Raikage-sama, the chakra Cannons are ready.

971
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:28,980
All right.
Men, load the chakra!

972
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:29,730
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

973
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:33,240
First, We'll fire the chakra Diffusion Cannon to pulverize the meteorites.

974
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,740
Pulverize, powderize.

975
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:03,270
I need assistance.

976
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:04,060
You got it.

977
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,060
Rasenshuriken!

978
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,060
螺旋手裏剣

979
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,060
(Rasenshuriken: "Spiralling Shuriken")

980
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,610
Kageshibari no Jutsu!

981
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,610
影縛りの術

982
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,610
(Kageshibari no Jutsu: "Shadow Bind Technique")

983
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:19,030
Next.

984
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:22,530
We're storming the citadel.

985
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:23,830
Right.

986
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:32,500
Sakura-chan.

987
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,760
Thanks, Naruto.

988
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,320
No need to thank me.

989
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,480
I have a debt to you that I'll never be able to repay.

990
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:55,440
What a drag.

991
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:58,900
Why hide it?

992
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:02,200
It's irritating, and prevents me from making wise decisions.

993
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:09,540
Naruto, can you sense Hanabi's chakra?

994
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,540
Hanabi is in that tower over there.

995
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,760
Sakura, Sai.
Take care of Hanabi.

996
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,630
-Okay
-Okay.

997
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,410
Hinata.

998
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,960
You bastard.

999
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,800
Your fist will never reach me.

1000
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:03,550
Naruto, where's Hinata?

1001
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,640
In there.

1002
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:08,810
I'll handle things here.

1003
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:09,850
Thanks.

1004
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:13,560
Move.

1005
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:20,150
Whoa, I won't let you pass.

1006
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:23,030
All right, the puppet show begins now.

1007
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:26,740
Hanabi is above here.

1008
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:32,580
What?

1009
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,630
This way.

1010
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:43,260
Hinata.

1011
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:54,060
Fūton: Kūsa Bōheki!

1012
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:54,060

1013
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:54,060
(Fūton: Kūsa Bōheki: "Wind Release: Air Sand Protective Wall")

1014
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,240
At six o'clock. It's a huge one.

1015
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,490
Everyone, Kakuyoku no Jin!

1016
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,490
鶴翼の陣

1017
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,490
(Kakuyoku no Jin: "Crane Wing Formation")

1018
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,990
-Roger
-Roger.

1019
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,630
Dai Roku Keimon!

1020
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,630
大六景門

1021
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,630
(Dai Roku Keimon: "The Gate of Joy")

1022
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:26,640
Damn it!

1023
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:46,440
You're...

1024
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:49,820
If he's not around..

1025
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,120
..the only one who can protect the village..

1026
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:54,750
..is me.

1027
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,710
Sasuke.

1028
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:00,920
The meteorites are gone.

1029
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:02,630
Hokage-sama.

1030
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,440
What is it?

1031
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,090
Hiashi-san.

1032
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:09,930
Chakra capacity at 75%

1033
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:13,600
76,77

1034
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,310
One after the other.

1035
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,570
Go in.

1036
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:34,410
Hinata.

1037
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:36,410
What did you do?

1038
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:37,830
Give Hinata back.

1039
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:41,710
Fine, I shall give her back to you.

1040
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:49,760
Stop, Hinata.

1041
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:54,040
What do you think of my wife's skills?

1042
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,140
Damn it.

1043
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,230
He's controlling her.

1044
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:03,400
Hinata.

1045
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,980
Bear with it for just a while.

1046
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,830
Don't you dare manipulate Hinata.

1047
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:23,670
Hinata belongs to me. 
I'm taking her back.

1048
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,510
Hinata.

1049
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,180
Be gone.

1050
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:39,140
Bastard.

1051
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,610
It's too early to wake up.

1052
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,530
Damn. 
The final pulsation.

1053
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:00,870
Naruto-kun.

1054
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,080
Hinata.

1055
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,340
I'm so sorry, Naruto-kun. I...

1056
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,380
I understand. 
So don't say anything.

1057
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:10,930
I'm the one who has to apologize.

1058
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:12,880
But, what about him?

1059
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:14,260
Now's our chance.

1060
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,810
We have to destroy the Tenseigan.

1061
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:18,140
Tenseigan?

1062
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,230
Hanabi.

1063
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:26,750
How terrible.

1064
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,160
She's just a child.

1065
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:36,620
Hinata.

1066
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:43,160
If we destroy this, the moon should stop it's approach.

1067
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:45,750
Got it, I'll use my Rasengan.

1068
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:46,420
No!

1069
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,630
There is a cursed jutsu cast upon this eye.

1070
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,340
Only someone with Hamura's blood can touch it,

1071
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,010
anyone else will get their chakra extracted.

1072
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:54,880
What?

1073
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:06,230
Hakke: Sōjishi Hōgeki!

1074
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:06,230
八卦:双獅子崩撃

1075
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:06,230
(Hakke: Sōjishi Hōgeki: "Eight Trigrams: Twin Lions Crumbling Attack")

1076
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,660
I can't destroy it.

1077
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:32,210
Hinata, Infuse me with your chakra.

1078
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,130
Huh?

1079
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,430
Then we might be able to break it apart.

1080
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,060
Let's go.

1081
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:46,060
Okay.

1082
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:56,830
(Info: This technique is Gentle Step Spiralling Twin Lion Fists ^_^)

1083
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,510
These are...

1084
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,680
The Tenseigan was a cluster of Byakugan?

1085
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:41,490
What?

1086
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:03,140
Hokage-sama.

1087
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:05,390
The moon has stopped it's approach.

1088
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,350
What?

1089
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,520
Chakra capacity at 95%

1090
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:16,650
96,97,98,99

1091
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,200
Chakra is at 100%

1092
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:22,530
Chakra Diffusion Cannon. Fire!

1093
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:23,740
Yeah.

1094
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:49,690
What just happened?

1095
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,310
An urgent message from the Cloud Village.

1096
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,900
A Five Kage Summit is being convened

1097
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,860
All the meteorites have been destroyed.

1098
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,490
So, you had a weapon like that hidden away?

1099
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:02,490
It seems we cannot be too careful with you, Raikage.

1100
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:05,120
Tsuchikage-sama, let's forget the sarcasm.

1101
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,080
Next up is the chakra Transportation Cannon.

1102
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,790
We'll blow up the moon.

1103
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:10,290
Blow up the moon?

1104
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,130
What's happening?

1105
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:18,960
Shikamaru.

1106
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:22,590
Hinata, are you all right?

1107
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:25,760
Yes, I'm sorry.

1108
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,760
Save that for later.

1109
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:32,390
Anyway, what happened? 
The artificial sun disappeared.

1110
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:35,230
We destroyed the Tenseigan.

1111
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,730
It was the source of power for everything.

1112
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,900
The moon should have stop moving too.

1113
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,860
What?

1114
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:52,250
The treasure that my entire clan offered their eyes to..

1115
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,420
..the Otsutsuki treasure..

1116
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:56,080
..how dare they.

1117
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,090
Hanabi.

1118
01:25:59,050 --> 01:25:59,880
Thank you.

1119
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:02,970
This is yours, right?

1120
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:06,430
Uh-huh.

1121
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:11,890
Isn't that the scarf that Toneri ripped off.

1122
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,730
How did you know?

1123
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:17,940
When I pulled Toneri's jutsu in you body.

1124
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,230
I was able to see your memories.

1125
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,990
You were going to give it to Naruto, Right?

1126
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,700
Did you make it for me?

1127
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:34,210
U-Uh-huh.

1128
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:36,750
Can I have it?

1129
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:40,460
But, It's in shreds.

1130
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,960
I don't care.

1131
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:47,010
I mean, I want it.

1132
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:04,030
Thank you.

1133
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,740
I'll cherish it.

1134
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,460
Naruto-kun.

1135
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,040
What's the matter?

1136
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:24,050
The clock..

1137
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,050
..it's moving.

1138
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:26,840
-Huh
-Huh

1139
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:33,430
With these eyes, Naruto.

1140
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:38,310
I'll destroy your world.

1141
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,070
It's too dangerous to blow up the moon.

1142
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:47,400
As long as there's a bomb called the moon,

1143
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:50,240
The earth will be not safe.

1144
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,640
Now, let's discuss this calmly.

1145
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:55,160
Right now, the moon has stopped it's approached.

1146
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,960
No, It hasn't stopped.

1147
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,000
What?

1148
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,260
Why is the clock ticking again?

1149
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:07,550
I don't know.

1150
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,060
W-What was that?

1151
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,240
Kurama!

1152
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:16,990
Kurama!

1153
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:18,840
It's Toneri.

1154
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:36,100
Ginrin Tensei Baku!

1155
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:36,100
銀輪転生爆

1156
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:36,100
(Ginrin Tensei Baku: "Silver Wheel Reincarnation Explosion")

1157
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,950
Chakra capacity at 90%

1158
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:01,790
Hokage-sama.

1159
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,170
Hiashi-san would like a word with you.

1160
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:05,080
Hiashi-san?

1161
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,670
Don't destroy the moon.

1162
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:15,340
I'm certain that Hanabi and Hinata are on the moon.

1163
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,090
What do you mean by that?

1164
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,100
Bad news.

1165
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:18,890
What is it?

1166
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:20,510
The Nine Tails is on the moon's surface.

1167
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:21,100
What?

1168
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,130
Chakra capacity at 95%

1169
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,890
Raikage-sama, an urgent message from Hokage-sama.

1170
01:30:57,890 --> 01:30:59,890
What does he want at a critical time?

1171
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,060
Please hold the Chakra Cannon.

1172
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,060
Naruto and the others are at the moon.

1173
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:05,600
It can't be helped.

1174
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,310
They have to be sacrificed for the sake of the humanity and the earth.

1175
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,730
We're going to fire the Chakra Transportation Cannon.

1176
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:13,400
-Raikage-dono.
-What is it?

1177
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:16,700
I'm asking you too. Wait one hour.

1178
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:17,490
What?

1179
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,030
I agree.

1180
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:19,870
Mizukage.

1181
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:22,280
Naruto is the hero of the last great war.

1182
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,290
He's worth betting on.

1183
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:25,330
Tsuchikage.

1184
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,960
Just one hour will do.

1185
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:37,280
But for them, that amount of time will be a worth a lifetime..

1186
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,390
..that can never be replaced.

1187
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:41,800
What do you based that on?

1188
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:45,390
My hunch.

1189
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,140
Hinata, are you okay?

1190
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:50,150
Uh-huh.

1191
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:51,480
No.

1192
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,410
I'm taking Hinata back.

1193
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:08,250
You can watch his last moments, from there.

1194
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:13,880
Hinata.

1195
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:23,600
Naruto-kun.

1196
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:53,540
The world created by the Sage of Six Paths is a failure.

1197
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,550
I'm destroying both the earth and you.

1198
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,640
I won't let the earth get destroyed.

1199
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:15,860
Rasenrangan!

1200
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:15,860

1201

(Rasenrangan: "Spiralling Strife Spheres")

1202
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:36,130

1203
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:36,130

(Kinrin Tensei Baku: "Golden Wheel Reincarnation Explosion")

1205
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:39,130
Naruto-kun.

1206
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,940
What is that?

1207
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:03,360
The moon..

1208
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:05,030
..the moon has split apart.

1209
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:05,740
What?

1210
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:09,580
What's happening?

1211
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,290
Hey, Hokage?

1212
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,040
There's only ten minutes left.

1213
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,520
He's done.

1214
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:22,260
I'm not done yet.

1215
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:40,050
Chōōdama Rasen Tarengan!

1216
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:40,050
超大玉螺旋多連丸

1217
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:40,050
(Chōōdama Rasen Tarengan: "Many Ultra-Big Ball Spiralling Serial Spheres")

1218
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:07,130
It's useless, give it up.

1219
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,140
Like, I'd give up.

1220
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:12,100
It takes time to knit a scarf.

1221
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:14,350
The deeper the feelings you want to convey..

1222
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:17,650
..the longer it takes to knit.

1223
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,440
It's over now.

1224
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:30,990
Like I'd let you.

1225
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:32,990
To convey one's feelings..

1226
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:37,120
..it takes much, much, much, more time.

1227
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,120
That's why..

1228
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:43,050
..I can't let it end, So easily!

1229
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,020
You got me with, one punch.

1230
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:08,070
The Tenseigan is fading.

1231
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,040
Huh?

1232
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:20,290
Hinata.

1233
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:22,040
Naruto-kun.

1234
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:32,010
I'm taking back Hanabi's eyes.

1235
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:35,350
No. Stop!

1236
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:38,430
Why you?

1237
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:41,400
This is over.

1238
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,690
Not yet.

1239
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:49,740
Sakura, are you okay?

1240
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:51,340
What about Naruto and the others?

1241
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,120
I don't know.

1242
01:36:57,910 --> 01:36:59,830
W-What's going on?

1243
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:08,590
I'll end it all with these eyes.

1244
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,590
Kugutsu Tensei!

1245
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,590

1247
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,270
You're annoying.

1248
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:24,980
Naruto.

1249
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,320
Hinata.

1250
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:30,440
Toneri, please stop it already.

1251
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:33,780
All you did was follow your ancestor's misguided teachings.

1252
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:37,830
Quiet! 
As the last survivor of the Otsutsuki Clan.

1253
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,910
I must fulfill Hamura's Celestial Decree.

1254
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:44,710
Naruto-kun.

1255
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:50,760
All my chakra's being sucked out.

1256
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:54,630
You'll know feel the power of Hamura,

1257
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,550
one that you can even move the moon.

1258
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,520
Naruto, it's over for you.

1259
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:06,110
Hinata?

1260
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:13,860
What?

1261
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,530
I won't let it end yet.

1262
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:17,660
Why?

1263
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,450
Hamura's chakra flows within me too.

1264
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:22,750
Stop it already!

1265
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,750
End it! The world of the Sage of Six Paths.

1266
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:36,890
I will destroy the Sage's world, that has fallen into darkness..

1267
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:39,890
..with the light of justice.

1268
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,210
What?

1269
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:08,700
His jutsu absorbed the sun's energy..

1270
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,650
..and now he's passed his chakra limits.

1271
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,430
Naruto-kun.

1272
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,640
Don't, it's too dangerous!

1273
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,110
Time's up.

1274
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,610
Fire the chakra Transportation Cannon!

1275
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:37,490
What's wrong?

1276
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:40,120
I can't shoot at Naruto.

1277
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,700
Stifle your personal feelings.

1278
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:43,790
The very existence of Earth depends on this.

1279
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:47,250
Move, I'll fire it!

1280
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,460
Raikage-sama, there is some writing on the moon.

1281
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:50,790
What?

1282
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:54,250
Kurama is writing something on the moon's surface.

1283
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:54,840
What?

1284
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,340
That Shinobi letter means..

1285
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:02,510
..mission accomplished.

1286
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:04,350
The mission was successful!

1287
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:06,020
I see.

1288
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,110
Every announcement to the entire world!

1289
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:15,440
The moon has stopped.

1290
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:18,610
Thanks to the efforts of these five..

1291
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:23,660
..Shikamaru, Sakura, Sai, Hinata, and Naruto,

1292
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,660
the future of Earth is safe.

1293
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:31,400
My hunches usually end on a high note.

1294
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:36,840
Making me write the letters..

1295
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,130
I'm bad at caligraphy.

1296
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,130
Sorry, Kurama.

1297
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:50,640
T-This is...

1298
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:54,830
Hamura's soul guided me here.

1299
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,340
Toneri, everyone on Earth will welcome you.

1300
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:09,160
I will remain on the moon and atone for my sins.

1301
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:12,540
Toneri.

1302
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:16,040
One day, one day.. 
come to Earth.

1303
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,090
The moon will never approach Earth.

1304
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:24,910
Never again.

1305
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,960
Naruto-kun, there's something I have to ask you.

1306
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,480
What is it?

1307
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,160
T-That scarf..

1308
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,860
..who gave it to you?

1309
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,160
Oh, this?

1310
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:47,410
My late mom made it for me?

1311
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:48,160
What?

1312
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:51,580
My Grandpa must've kept it for her.

1313
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:53,580
Mom.

1314
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:56,000
I see.

1315
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,280
I'm so silly.

1316
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:59,200
Hey, Onee-sama!

1317
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:03,050
How long are you going to chit-chat? I'm going on ahead of you.

1318
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:06,150
Hurry up, the passageway is starting to disintegrate.

1319
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:10,970
Let's go home to Earth.

1320
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:12,390
Yes.

1321
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:30,740
Hinata.

1322
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:31,700
Yes?

1323
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:33,750
Back in school..

1324
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:37,080
..when we were asked who we'd want to spend your last day on Earth with?

1325
01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:39,800
I couldn't write anyone's name down.

1326
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:43,470
I didn't know my parents, and I didn't have any friends.

1327
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,090
But now,

1328
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:47,570
I know exactly who'd I'd choose. 
I want to stay with you.

1329
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:55,440
Now and forever, until I die..

1330
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,310
..I want to be with you, Hinata.

1331
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:02,280
Naruto-kun.

1332
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:45,650
Naruto-kun.

1333
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,300
Hinata, put your arms around me.

1334
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:49,090
Huh?

1335
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,590
O-Okay.

1336
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,930
Don't let it go, okay?

1337
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:57,720
I won't.

1338
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:04,150
I'll never, ever let it go.

1339
01:45:07,410 --> 01:45:09,010
Huh? What are you doing?

1340
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:17,580
Onee-sama.

1341
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:20,580
Naruto, you're going to crash into the ceiling.

1342
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:22,580
Like I'm going to let it stop here.

1343
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,270
Hinata.

1344
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:41,350
Naruto-kun.

1345
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:02,860
Thank you, Hinata.

uchuu ni natta

1382
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:48,650
Why, oh why, are we born crying,

1383
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:54,650
Then someday made to cry again, before we go on to become stars.

1384
01:46:54,760 --> 01:47:00,760
Why, oh why, though we weren't ever taught.

1385
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:06,710
Do we know how to shed tears?

1386
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:11,500
The drops that well up are

1387
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:17,600
an unending symbol of lavished love.

1388
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:29,850
As they are led along, they make themselves known softly, gently.

1389
01:47:33,170 --> 01:47:39,700
From heart to body, as body becomes heart,

1390
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:45,550
With all the many intertwined spiral formations involved.

1391
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:51,400
If we can see the future in each and every one,

1392
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,400
even this sky we're gazing upon

1393
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:59,200
Will seem as part of the cosmos.

1394
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:14,600
Why, oh why, does the moon,

1395
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:20,400
Never say a thing as it illuminates the darkness.

1396
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:26,450
Why, oh why, though we know there's a limit to our heartbeats,

1397
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:32,400
Do we still spend them wastefully?

1398
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:37,400
Rather than trying to assign value

1399
01:48:38,490 --> 01:48:43,390
based on the size of the vessels we hold in our chests,

1400
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:55,600
I'd rather try to feel the life coming from the warmed seeds within.

1401
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:05,500
No matter how much we squint our eyes, trying to see ourselves,

1402
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:11,250
It'll still be too blurry to make out, until we lose track of it completely.

1403
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:17,260
If the more we search, the more it will fall to pieces,

1404
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,120
even acts of imitation,

1405
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:25,650
Yes, are better off created by our own hands.

1406
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:45,970
What it means to live life, surely,

1407
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:51,350
is to let go little by little.

1408
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:58,970
Then at the moment you lose your last,

1409
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,740
there's someone by your side

1410
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:09,400
to give you their tears.

1411
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:13,250
With that alone, we're happy.

1412
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:19,610
From heart to body, as body becomes heart,

1413
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:25,650
With all the many inherited spiral formations involved.

1414
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:31,450
From the moment we perceived of this repetition as eternity,

1415
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:34,380
all of the scenery before our eyes,

1416
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:40,000
Now, became part of the cosmos.

1417
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:45,220
Became part of the cosmos.

1418
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:48,650
どうしてどうして泣いて生まれて

1419
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:54,650
いつか泣かれて星になっていくんだろう

1420
01:46:54,760 --> 01:47:00,760
僕らはどうしてどうして教わってないのに

1421
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:06,710
涙の流し方は知ってるんだろう

1422
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:11,500
溢れる雫は絶え間なく

1423
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:17,600
注がれた愛情の証で

1424
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:29,850
導かれるままゆるやかにそっと伝ってきたんだ

1425
01:47:33,170 --> 01:47:39,700
こころからからだへからだはこころへ

1426
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:45,550
連なるいくつもの絡み合ったらせんの模様

1427
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:51,400
そのひとつひとつに未来が見えたなら

1428
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,400
眺めているこの空も

1429
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:59,200
ほら宇宙に見える

1430
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:14,600
どうしてどうして月はいつでも

1431
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:20,400
何も言わないで闇を照らしているんだろう

1432
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:26,450
僕らはどうしてどうして鼓動の数に

1433
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:32,400
限りがあるってのを知っていてムダにしちゃうんだろう

1434
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:37,400
胸に抱えている器の

1435
01:48:38,490 --> 01:48:43,390
大きさに価値を見出すんじゃなくて

1436
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:55,600
その中にある熱を帯びたタネに“生命(いのち)”を感じたい

1437
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:05,500
どんなに眼を凝らして自分を見ようとしても

1438
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:11,250
ぼやけてよく見えないやそのうち見失ってしまう

1439
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:17,260
探せば探すほど散らかしてしまうなら

1440
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,120
見様見真似だってこの手で

1441
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:25,650
そう作ればいい

1442
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:45,970
生きるっていうことそれはきっと

1443
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:51,350
少しずつ手放していくこと

1444
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:58,970
最後の一つを失うその時

1445
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,740
そばにいて

1446
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:09,400
涙をくれる人がいる

1447
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:13,250
それで嬉しい

1448
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:19,610
こころからからだへからだはこころへ

1449
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:25,650
連なるいくつもの受け継ぐらせんの模様

1450
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:31,450
繰り返されてくことが永遠だと思えた時

1451
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:34,380
